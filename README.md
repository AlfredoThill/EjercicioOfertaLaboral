This simple code is used to convert downloaded "googlespreadsheets" files to csv, only one sheet of the original file will be converted. Google Drive allows to download a compressed file by converting its collections to the usual Windows folder and subfolder format. The code includes an iterator to find the files in the format specified within these folders and two auxiliary functions with a "picker" to detail the input and output folders.
